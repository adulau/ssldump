# ssldump - (de-facto repository gathering patches around the cyberspace)

![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/adulau/ssldump/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)

- Current version of ssldump is v1.1 (released: 2019-12-28) - [ChangeLog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adulau/ssldump/master/ChangeLog)

This repository is composed of the original SSLDUMP 0.9b3 + a myriad of patches (from Debian and other distributions) + contributions via PR

ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP
connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret
them as SSLv3/TLS traffic. When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it
decodes the records and displays them in a textual form to stdout. If
provided with the appropriate keying material, it will also decrypt
the connections and display the application data traffic.

# Why do you maintain this repository?

Because it's a mess. The software maintenance process for old free (unmaintained) software
like ssldump is a complete chaotic process. I do this to ease my pain and this could help
other too (but this is just a collateral damage).

# Where do you use ssldump?

I used it for a relatively small project called Passive SSL. For more information, [Passive SSL Passive Detection and Reconnaissance Techniques, to Find, Track, and Attribute Vulnerable ”Devices”](https://www.first.org/resources/papers/conf2015/first_2015_-_leverett_-_dulaunoy_-_passive_detection_20150604.pdf).
Additional back-end code available is in the [crl-monitor ](https://github.com/adulau/crl-monitor/tree/master/bin/x509) repository.

# Build instructions

On Debian & Ubuntu:
```
apt install build-essential autoconf libssl-dev libpcap-dev
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
(optional) make install
```

On Fedora, Centos & RHEL:
```
dnf install autoconf automake gcc make openssl-devel libpcap-devel
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
(optional) make install
```

Optional configuration features (aka ./configure options):
```
  --disable-optimization  disable compiler optimizations (change from -O2 to -O0)
  --enable-debug	  enable debug info (add "-g -DDEBUG" to CFLAGS)
  --enable-asan		  enable AddressSanitizer and other checks
	add "-fsanitize=address,undefined,leak -Wformat -Werror=format-security -Werror=array-bounds" to CFLAGS
	use libasan with GCC and embedded ASAN with Clang
```

Configuration examples:
```
- Use GCC with libasan, debug info and custom CFLAGS:
	./configure CC=/usr/bin/gcc --enable-asan --enable-debug CFLAGS="-Wall"

- Use Clang with ASAN and no optimizations (-O0)
	./configure CC=/usr/bin/clang --enable-asan --disable-optimization
```

The contributing policy is simple. If you have a patch to propose, make a pull-request
via the interface. If the patch works for me, it's merged.
