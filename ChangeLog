* Merge pull request #102 from the-real-tokai/fix-fdatasync-osx. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Fix problematic fdatasync() call on macOS

* Fix problematic fdatasync() call on macOS. [Christian Rosentreter]

  The fdatasync call generates a "implicit declaration of function 'fdatasync' is invalid in C99" warning when building for macOS (it's nowhere to be found in the system includes), but linking will eventually work fine because there is an unrelated syscall by the same name (different prototype), so it's not doing what it should. So lets not use it.

  Handle weird 3-way handshake(syn&ack -> syn -> ack)

* Handle weird 3-way handshake(syn&ack -> syn -> ack) I have pcaps from Cisco2960 span port and found some tcp handshake has weird order 3-way handshake. It seems first packet order between sessions is not guaranted for cisco span. maybe. Current state transition is         INIT -- syn --> SYN1 -- syn&ack --> SYN2 -- ack --> ESTABLISHED New state transition starts with SYN1 or SYN2 and adds(revive actually) STATE_ACK to handle both cases. case1 : INIT -- syn --> SYN1 -- syn&ack -->ACK -- ack --> ESTABLISHED (normal) case2 : INIT -- syn&ack --> SYN2 -- syn -->ACK -- ack --> ESTABLISHED (weird) [EaseTheWorld]
